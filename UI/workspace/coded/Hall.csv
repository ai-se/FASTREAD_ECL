The Back Propagation Neural Network Model of Non-Periodic Defected Ground Structure,"Presently, electromagnetic field numerical value analysis methods such as finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method are generally used to calculate the DGS, although these methods are accurate, they are also computationally expensive. In this paper, a neural network model of a novel defected ground structure is established. Since the neural network model has the advantages of great precision and effectiveness, the developed design model can be used to take the place of the FDTD method of the DGS, being a kind of aid tool of circuit design. The neural network models of two different non-periodic DGS have been developed, at the same time the circuit of the according DGS is designed and manufactured. The result of computer simulation and product measurements are obtained to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",2008,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534548,no,yes,222408
An improved method of differential fault analysis on SMS4 key schedule,"SMS4 is a 128-bit block cipher published as the symmetric-key encryption standard of Wireless Local Area Network(WLAN) by China in 2006. By inducing faults into the key schedule, we propose an improved method of differential fault attack on the key schedule of the SMS4 cipher. The result shows that our attack can recover its secret key by introducing 4 faulty ciphertexts.",2010,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497698,no,yes,222410
A taxonomy of software security defects for SST,"Software security test (SST) is a useful way to validate software system security attribute. Defects based testing technologies are more effective than traditional specification testing technologies, and more and more researchers pay their attention to the testing methods. Before testing, an organized list of actual defects is especially essential. But at present the only existing suitable taxonomies are mostly for software designers or tool-builders, and do not adequately represent security defects that are found in modern software. In our work, we have coalesced previous efforts to categorize security errors as well as problem reports in order to create a kind of security defects taxonomy. We correlate this taxonomy with available information about current Top 10 software dangerous errors, which come from CWE, SANS and other authoritative vulnerabilities enumerations. We suggest that this taxonomy is suitable for software security testers and to outline possible areas of future research.",2010,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5656736,no,no,222412
Tunable fault tolerance for runtime reconfigurable architectures,"Fault tolerance is becoming an increasingly important issue, especially in mission-critical applications where data integrity is a paramount concern. Performance, however, remains a large driving force in the market place. Runtime reconfigurable hardware architectures have the power to balance fault tolerance with performance, allowing the amount of fault tolerance to be tuned at run-time. This paper describes a new built-in self-test designed to run on, and take advantage of, runtime reconfigurable architectures using the PipeRench architecture as a model. In addition, this paper introduces a new metric by which a user can set the desired fault tolerance of a runtime reconfigurable device",2000,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903405,no,no,222414
